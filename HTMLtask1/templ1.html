    <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary<br> time needed to understand your product vision.<br> 
      The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br> 
      Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces<br> you need. </p>
