        India Election Results: Gandhi Concedes as Modi Makes History

        With a commanding lead, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party are
        set to expand their majority. “India wins yet again!” he posted on

      <p>
        Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the most powerful and divisive
        leaders India has produced in decades, appeared easily headed for
        another five-year term, according to election returns so far.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        The Election Commission reported that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party,
        or B.J.P., was ahead in at least 300 parliamentary districts, far beyond
        the 272 seats it would need for a majority in the 543-seat Parliament.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        At this pace, the party would actually expand on its current majority —
        a development no one was predicting in recent months. In Prime Minister
        Narendra Modi’s small inner circle, the B.J.P.’s president, Amit Shah,
        is perhaps his closest confidante. And outside of Mr. Modi himself, Mr.
        Shah is the party operative most credit with helping to engineer this
        victory.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="article-details__blockquote">
          The main opposition Congress Party was ahead in 49 seats, according to
          Election Commission data.
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        But that was before tensions with Pakistan handed Mr. Modi an issue he
        could command. He campaigned heavily on national security and on a
        forceful foreign policy, and it's now clear that played well among
        India’s 900 million registered voters.

      <p>
        Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party, conceded defeat
        on Thursday after it was clear that Mr. Modi’s party had swept the
        election. “I said during the campaign that the people were the masters,
        and today they have given their verdict,” Mr. Gandhi said at a brief
        news conference from Congress headquarters in New Delhi. “We concede in
        this election that Narendra Modi and the B.J.P. have won.”

      <p>
        For much of the election campaign, Mr. Shah, 54, a Hindu hard-liner who
        is projected to win a parliamentary seat in the state of Gujarat,
        focused his attention on the state of West Bengal, home to many of
        India’s Muslims. And his rhetoric has been bluntly anti-Muslim. In
        countless speeches there, he painted his rivals as soft on illegal
        immigration from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which borders West Bengal.
        He accused opposition politicians of funding Islamic schools that
        jeopardized India’s Hindus.
